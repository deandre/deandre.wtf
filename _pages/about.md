Originally from St. Louis / Chicago and now based in Cape Town, I blend my passion for photography with a love for technology. When I'm not capturing moments through my lens, I'm diving into my work as a Support Engineer at a software company.

I also enjoy spinning vinyl records, sipping on a gin & tonic, and indulging in a good dirty chai. You'll often find me with my cat, Tumi, and exploring contemporary art.
