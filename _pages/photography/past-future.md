title: The Past is Theirs, the Future is Ours

_The past is theirs; the future is ours_, South African visual artist XP Matshikiza boldly proclaims. This sentiment echoes throughout his generation, a generation to whom the reductive qualifier “post-apartheid” is often carelessly ascribed.

In this work I look at the current generation of young adults in South Africa who are navigating identities that are not limited by such rhetoric. I am interested in their lived experiences and what it means to grow-up in a time and place that is post-“posts.”

Their grandparents have lived through the colonial centuries; their parents, the modern century. This is the new century and with it comes an entirely new struggle.
