> _Supporters of the [Federal Marriage] amendment say Congress is the right place to set cultural standards, and that traditional marriages are the foundation of healthy societies. Those on this side of the debate draw a connection between nontraditional families, poverty and troubled children._

<em>â€” From the Newsvine article _[Senate Debate on Gay Marriage to Continue](https://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/06/06/244964-senate-debate-on-gay-marriage-to-continue "Newsvine - Senate Debate on Gay Marriage to Continue")_, Tue 6 June 2006</em>

I hate to be a naysayer, but if that's the case, then look at how far traditional marriages have gotten us. Someone who sees these connections, please, I beg of you!---help me to see them too.

More from me soon, I promise.
