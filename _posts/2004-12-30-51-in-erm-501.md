I thought Karsh's _[101 in 1001](https://www.blackgayblogger.com/archives/2004/12/27/101_in_1001/)_ was a good idea, so I decided to do something similar. I have never made a resolution — at least that I remember — but I figured why not? It's (gonna be) 2005. I feel a little extra guidance couldn't hurt. Enter 51 in 501.

**The Mission:** Complete 51 preset tasks in a period of 501 days.

**The Criteria:** Tasks must be specific (i.e., no ambiguity in the wording) with a result that is either measurable or clearly defined. Tasks must also be realistic and stretching (i.e., represent some amount of work on your part).

This list was completed on 30 December 2004, so 501 days from now would be 14 May 2006. I'm sure I'll be graduating around then, so the timeframe is perfect. That is, if I did the math right.

1. Help Jewell learn how to ride a bike
2. Get a job with a local coffee shop, bookstore, or **\_\_**
3. Better the relationship with my mother
4. Stop getting caught up on straight boys that I can't have...
5. ...And find a queer one that I can
6. Finish _[1984](https://amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0452262933/002-1974510-3363216?v=glance)_, _[Body of Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385499086/qid=1104394478/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/002-1974510-3363216)_, _[Codes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1579120407/qid=1104394513/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1974510-3363216?v=glance&s=books)_, _[Crypto](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140244328/qid=1104394533/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/002-1974510-3363216)_, _[Snow Crash](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380958/qid=1104394559/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/002-1974510-3363216)_ and _[The Code Book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385495323/qid=1104394588/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/002-1974510-3363216)_
7. Once I've read those, finish books within a reasonable amount of time
8. Master Photoshop, graphic design, and CSS so I could make my **own** CRUNK layouts
9. I'm sure a 4.0 is pushing it, so I'll settle for a 3.5

17. Get serious about IB Art? IB in general?
18. Make time for myself to do stuff I enjoy
19. Further consider going/go organic
20. Throw a party (togas and wrestling in KY jelly sound like fun...)
21. Go to MoKaBe's trivia night for once
22. Check out more of the local/indie music/film/theatre scene
23. On a further note, check out the scene in general
