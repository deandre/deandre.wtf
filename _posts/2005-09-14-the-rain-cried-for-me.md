Earlier in the day, a certain something was revealed to me that resulted in me getting sulky. After work, sitting under drizzle and rolling thunder, I told him. It felt great to get out. While waiting at the bus stop, getting blown here and there, unable to see for shit, I felt lighthearted and carefree. In that moment, it seemed like nothing could go wrong. On the other hand, I wanted to cry. But there was no need; the rain cried for me.
