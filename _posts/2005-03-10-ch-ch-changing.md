There is a vile little six-letter word that seems to ignite animosity in our minds. Although it is not obscene, one might think otherwise based on people's reactions to it. We cringe at the implication of it. That word, my friend, is change.

People fear it. They get settled into their routines and find comfort in the monotonism(?). When someone comes along and tries to interfere, they go on the defensive: things are fine as is, great even. Why change?

The hypothetical discussion that occurred the other day in TOK (EVOLVE) reminded me of the current situation the NSA (perhaps the IC) finds itself in: its people do not want to adapt to combat "a different kind of threat." Its employ consists largely of old(er) people who, though very experienced, are overly set in their ways.

Despite my tolerance of change (I like to spice things up, keep things interesting), I too have resisted it. A good example would be of my disapproval of certain policies of Metro's administration that I felt/feel were/are ridiculous (i.e. kicking people out after school).\

Anyway, I pose this question to you: why not?
