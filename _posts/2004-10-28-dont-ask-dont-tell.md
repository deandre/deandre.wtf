It was only 11 pages this time, the Biology test, as it were. I failed it; I am quite sure of that.

My adventures within NGA were quite the interesting. That place is friggin' huge (I wonder if it would be inappropriate to post a map of the facility?). However, I was thoroughly disappointed with the main buidling itself--there were no white, sterile hallways! So much for that, but it was a much needed reality check. The varying degrees of secrecy and the security measures aside, NGA is relatively normal. A lot of old people work there, and therefore, I can kiss my pretty spy boy goodbye. I want to assume the same applies to the rest of the Intelligence Community (read: NSA), but that, I feel, would be a half-assed assumption. I still feel that NSA is far superior/cooler than NGA. I have yet to determine the big deal with maps--why be so secretive about them? I just do not see the point, and sadly, no one subjected themselves to answering my questions (with the exception of "Bluejay").

Shawn is such the hottie. I just thought that I would reiterate that.

I am going to give _[Body of Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385499086/102-0079349-0923348?v=glance)_ another try (I never got too far in it, for whatever reasons).
