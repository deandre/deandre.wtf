Just a seriously quick update from me.

It seems as if school might as well be over. I rarely go to class, if I have any to go to, and more often than not I arrive late.

Tomorrow is the last day of training for the peer mentoring program. To be honest, I've really enjoyed it---I've met a wonderful group of people and learned ridiculous amounts of stuff. It has been tiring (having to be up so early and staying still for so long, then having to work afterwards), but I think it's worth it.

I ran my idea for Scoopers Making Change by Mark tonight. He loved it, which is great because now I'm even more excited. I've decided that I personally will have no objections to starting school in the spring (I understand and appreciate your concern, Julia. Believe me, the last thing I'm going to do is stay around here.) I'm still going to save for the deposits, then pay those once I can. But it will be nice having a little bit of extra change for my planned trip to Chicago (Pretty Girls Make Graves, et. al.).

The recent surge in me being harrassed because of my percieved sexual orientation while walking to and fro bus stops has sparked an interest in matters of race and sexuality. It can be hard enough being gay, but being gay and part of a culture which is known for its hypermasculinity, misogynism, and inherent homophobia certainly makes things more interesting. In the past couple of weeks, I was followed part of the way home by a group of people as well as taunted by yet another on two seperate occasions (these are the more notable). I'm not one to be afraid---as I shared with the group today: I believe that people are generally good---but during these incidents, I was certainly concerned for my safety. I mean really, how much would it have sucked to be bashed in the middle of night only a couple of blocks from home? [That shit happens](https://www.rashawnbrazell.com/).

Not really sure where or who to look to, I'm reading Keith Boykin's _One More River to Cross: Black & Gay in America_. It's quite excellent, I must say. Perhaps I'll respond to it at a later date, but for now

Good night, and good luck.
