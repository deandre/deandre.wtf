Today. First day (of school).

Me myself, I am starting over. And in many ways.

Afterschool. I greeted a woman--a stranger--as I walked the street to meet Jewell. I met Jewell. I thought that rather than sticking with my old, let us try something new. We checked out a new coffeeshop called Rhythm and Brews. Feeling willing, I tried a Cafe Latte to accompany my Lunchable. Even after several packets of sugar, I still did not like it. So I ordered a Naked food-juice to replace it, which was pretty delicious, though thick.

At this barista, the cashier chick and I enjoyed a nice little conversation. She was pretty cool, and Rhythm and Brews now makes my lists of ideal hangouts.

Some people were definately a sight for sore eyes. Shawn. That boy is damned sexy.
