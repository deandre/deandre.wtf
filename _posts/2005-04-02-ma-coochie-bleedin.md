This week has provided me with many first time experiences. Well, I can't think of any from the beginning of the week, so I'll go with today. I've never actually sat down with Shawn and talked with him, even if only for a moment (in art, and I paid him a brief visit during lunch). I've driven through [the Loop](https://www.ucityloop.com/), but never actually hung (which apparantly isn't a word) out there until today. With that came my first visits to [Vintage Vinyl](https://www.vintagevinyl.com/), Bubble Tea, and many other places, although I bought nothing except for a $1.50 soda from some Mexican place, because I'm too broke.

Between learning of periods, 'ginies, and other random stuff, this week has also been educational.

Oh, so much for [debts to the library of less than a dollar](/51-in-501/)(#40). I owe them $4.10! This need to be paid off ASAP because my card has expired and needs to be renewed (just my luck).

While I'm at it, how about a couple of quick [51 in 501](/51-in-501/) updates?

- **#2** Got a job at [Ben & Jerry's](https://benjerry.com/) in [the CWE](https://www.thecwe.com/). Not quite local, but the next best thing.
- **#4** For the most part, I have no major feelings for any of my 1, 2, 3, 4(?) Crushes. Now for **#5**.
