I made a terrible mistake. Rather than using the "study tips" I have learned over the summer, I generally ignored them. I did not reread my notes within 24 hours to clarify, and whatnot. No. By now I hope I would have realized that cramming the night before for what I hear to be a 14-page biology exam is not the best way to go about getting a decent grade on the thing.

A space heater shortcircuited, causing power in half of the house to go out. That sucked, not because I was in the dark (my room was unaffected), but I was in the middle of heating up a "study snack." Space heater + microwave + computer equipment + TVs + countless other electrical devices = not a good combination, especially to be operated all at once, for a rather old house with not so modern wiring.

I am, however, feeling fairly confident. I figure, if I could go over the study guide, and say atleast a couple of things about each topic, then I will be all right.
