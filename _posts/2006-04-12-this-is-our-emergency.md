I happened upon [segments](https://www.xxlmag.com/mb/index.php?showtopic=25401) of [Hood 2 Hood](https://www.streetgangs.com/movies/hood2hood.html), the so-called "blockumentary" that for some time now I've wanted to see. Is it natural to be angry and stupified all while watching this? This is the biggest bunch of BS I've ever seen. Not only does it present inaccurate rubbish about what's "real" in the city, it also perpetuates the negative portrayal of urban America typical of the mainstream media. It's poorly produced, much like that candy rap heard on Top 40 radio networks. If I were to ever become rich, one of the first things I would do is buy out all of the American media outlets, and fire everybody. It's either that or something I can't mention because I wouldn't want to incriminate myself.

Is anyone with me on this? I am beyond frustrated. Today is Senior Skip Day. I don't know if there was some class gathering planned, but I do know that I will be at the History Museum and the Art Dimensions gallery downtown, as well as getting some reading done in a park. Feel free to join, you have my number.
