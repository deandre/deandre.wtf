It's official. There will be no strike. I suppose that's good---although no one got exactly what they wanted, everyone got something. Except me.

I need some drama, people! Blow something up, build a Wal-Mart, something. Let's shake things up a bit.

I'm not sure ifÂ GSA's going to meet this week. Regardless of if we do or not, I've finally completed the [climate survey](https://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/all/news/record/1413.html). Now, to run it by Georgia and we'll go from there. I need to get something going soon if we're going to observe the [Day of Silence](https://www.dayofsilence.org/). What to do, what to do?

I regret to say that I am once again an American. For the past year or so, I've watched so little television. Somehow, I'm back in the habit. Between Alias, Will and Grace, and the obligatory Oprah (which I'm taping today), I can't seem to get away from the thing. It has gotten to the point where I chuckle at the silly puns in shows and commercials. I disappoint myself.
