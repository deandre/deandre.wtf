Oh, the lessons I learn. I fainted today during my Group IV presentation. I remember everything: I remember feeling something, just bad. I felt weak, nauseated, dizzy, and couldn't see. I leaned up against the copier, next thing I know I can feel myself stumbling around. I heard everything; I think Julia even came up and asked if I was okay. I just couldn't see.

It was really weird, embarassing even. That has never happened to me. So this is what happens when you pull two all-nighters in a row and don't eat? And to think I was considering fasting this weekend. Unfortunately I missed Lorenc's presentation on that.

I'm not treating myself as I should, and this is my body letting me know. Time to listen up, right?
