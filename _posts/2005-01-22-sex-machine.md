As a general rule of thumb, I do not like to be yelled at. On the flip side, I **love** pretty boys in black meshed shirts. How about that body rockin'? Last night I met up with Alex, Bridgette, Candice, Jewelz, and Stan for a hip-hop show at the Pageant. Despite the opportunity, there was no crazed fool dancing on my part. A quarter of the way into the third act, I came down with a major headache — one of those debilitating ones that are like "Mon Dieu!" Still, I decked it out until they completed their performance, at which point Candice and I sat down. I left soon after, but didn't wanna go. I really was having a good time. Definately journal worthy.

I love the Pageant. Not only is its location awesome, but the place itself is so small and intimate, so small, in fact, that smoke accumulates fast — and a lotta people were smoking. That bothers me (observe the present tense). I've never been fond of the stuff, and it turns me off when people smoke. Quoting some guy from the *Bon Voyage!* textbook, "I feel it in my skin." And believe me when I say it is not a good feeling.

Has anyone heard about the three top East Saint Louis officials, **including the police chief**, who were arrested by the Feds? That's some crazy stuff.
