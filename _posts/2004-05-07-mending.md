me in u**M**bra\
alone, desolate, dark\
that candle? extinguished\
it was once my guiding light,\
my source of hope.\
gone.\
j'ai copains\
alon**E** nonetheless\
maybe that's not the case\
but it feels that w**A**y\
i see you\
laughing, dan**C**ing, ...\
and i wonder how you can...\
seem so **U**naffected\
me? i'm. s.o. miserable.\
you don't even acknow**L**edge me\
no hug, no hi(!)\
nothing.\
totally ignored.\
hel**P** me understand\
t**A**lk to me.
