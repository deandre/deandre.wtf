The craziest weekend. Spent so much money, it's ridiculous; tried to justify myself by saying what's the point of having it and not spending it? Fuck that. Prom: got better towards the end. I at first felt out of place, began to wonder why did I even go. It wasn't for me. That first slow song was the pits: I sat there chugging my red-colored Sprite, wishing it contained alchohol. But it got better towards the end. I got out of that frame of mind and warmed up to people. Thoroughly enjoyed Candice and Casey; they were so cute. Between the trolley, the abnormally huge Ted Drewes "regular," early-morning escapades, cops, drunkenness, White Castle's, FUCK 40, and other trivial details not particularly in that order, the weekend was good. I'm over it; good vibes to the both of you.

And to my mom: fuck you. I'm through with it.

Bitch.
