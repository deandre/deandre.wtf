Just a little burned out. Even with school ending I'm still incredibly busy with work. (That, my friends, is the result of asking for more hours.) But, I need the money, or so I tell myself---saving up for school, you know.

I'm also in the process of looking for if not another, then a second job. The parking garage next to the library posted the availability of a position, which I will inquire about on Monday.

Eh, I have a couple of entries drafted, one on graduation and another on that naughtly little four-letter word:Â *oreo*.
