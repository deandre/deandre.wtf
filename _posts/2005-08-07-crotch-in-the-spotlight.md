Last night, I probably attended one of the best concerts in quite sometime. As many have been made aware, I was (very) apprehensive about going at first. By the time I got off work, I was exhausted from being on my feet all day (the walk to ad from the "nearby" Schnucks helped none), and I simply wanted to go home.

Allison picked me up from Cassie's. I felt gross wearing my sister's shirt twice in three days (because my mom refuses to take me to do laundry, I had no clean clothes), so I had her stop by Rag-O-Rama. I have never been in and out of that store so fast (they were about to close)!

I didn't have time toÂ *shop shop*, perhaps for the better, because I seriously need to save money. But of the many shirts that I browsed through, there were only a few that I deemed small enough/worthy; of those, I bought two. One' black and I think a band shirt, the other's olive and has Che Guevara on it: I'm going to screen print over both.

From there, we went on to Mississippi Nights. Completely unaware of the lineup, I didn't know what to expect. I eventually learned that The Famed (who we missed), Upside, and Thos were opening for Pomeroy. Allison had told me that it was a Thos concert, which is part of the reason why I didn't want to go. I don't remember being to fond of them last time I saw them, but their performance last night grew on me, with such catchy songs as "Stomp Feet" and "Sundance(?)."

Every concert I attend, there is guaranteed to be that one boy that catches my eye. At one of the Loop Undergrounds, there was the boy in mesh. (I admit, that was superficial.) Last night, there was this extraordinarily pretty boy who I really would have liked to get to know. All night, he danced (so to speak) wonderfully, and he had very nice hair, and he just gave off an air of coolness. Man. I wanted to go say hi to him so badly, get his name, compliment his moves, and perhaps exchange Myspaces. It's so much easier said than done. Actually, not really. As Allison and I pulled out of our alley parking space, we saw the lady who sang with Pomeroy. I enjoyed her performance, so I wanted to tell her that and that she put on a good show. I did so with no hesitation. In this, I noticed some deeper underlying issue. You lose, you learn. I'm a strong proponent of there's always a next time.

And speaking of, next time I complain as much as I did, please slap the shit out of me.
