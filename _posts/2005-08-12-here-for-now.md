Despite the many invitations from my sister to live with her in Jeff. City, I've decided to stay put. Much credit goes to Allison, for this:

> Allison: i dont like the jeff city idea\
> Allison: even for non-selfish reasons\
> Kevin: elaborate\
> Allison: well while everyone should try to leave stl, except those i hate, i dont see another city in missouri being any better\
> Allison: ive never been to jeff city myself but ive never heard a good thing about it\
> Allison: and it is an even smaller city thatn stl and due to its location, i imagine more close-minded and prolly more religious as well\
> Allison: i think the main reason youd have to go is to get away from your mom, which i think is becoming increasingly unimportant\
> Allison: i think you are learning how to tolerate her and you are gaining independance\
> Allison: you no longer depend on her much and therefore she has a decreasing amount of influence over you\
> Allison: while she can still make you miserable to a certain extent, i dunno if she is good enough reason to go\
> Allison: while you say youd come back to visit via amtrak, the likelihood isnt good honestly\
> Allison: therefore, all new friends are pretty much required and i dont know that they would be more accepting in general down there\
> Allison: i think you need to finish school at metro\
> Allison: dropping ib and leaving metro seems like a bad idea for your situation\
> Allison: metro doesnt seem to conflict with you too badly in most ways and so i think you should try to get what you can from it\
> Allison: plus switching schools your senior year would suck\
> Kevin: (don't drop ib?)\
> Allison: no\
> Allison: i think you need to drop ib\
> Allison: but dropping ib AND leaving metro sounds bad to me\
> Kevin: (stick with ib art?)\
> Allison: if you think you should\
> Allison: i think that might be good
