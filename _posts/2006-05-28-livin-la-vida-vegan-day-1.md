For no good reason (I'll go into it at a later time) I'm giving a shot at veganism.

Let me just begin by saying that there is nothing to eat in my house, at all! Yesterday morning I ran over to the corner store to buy wheat bread. I figured I'd atleast be able to make some of those peanut butter and honey sandwiches that I love so much. Before I left for work, I asked my mom if we could go to the grocery store soon so that I can hit the kitchen.

While I don't consume what my place of work sells, the lure of that which I couldn't have was tempting. I kept control though and was really proud of myself for it. When I did give in, it was for the sorbets (they're water-based).

Incredibly hungry, I decided to go to Straub's during my break, but not before a quick stop to the library for books on veganism. I managed to find one, [The Voluptuous Vegan](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609804898/boihazard-20?tag=boihazard-20 "The Voluptuous Vegan: More Than 200 Sinfully Delicious Recipes for Meatless, Eggless, and Dairy-Free Meals"), which I perused while browsing the aisles at Straub's (well, before focusing my attention on a very cute stock boy). I walked out of the door with fruit salad and a box of [Multi-Grain Wheat Thins](https://www.nabiscoworld.com/Brands/ProductInformation.aspx?BrandKey=WHEATTHINS&Site=1&Product=4400004802 "Nabisco Multi-Grain Wheat Thins"), which I've been snacking on in lieu of the pizza that was waiting for me when I got home.

That day over, I think I've done very well. Let's see what challenges this one brings.

Afterthought: I was supposed to play tennis with Tyi this morning. Already it's 4 a.m. What's the likelihood of that happening? And I'll be going to Straub's more often---what was it? Boyd?
