I woke up late this morning, around 7, my mom yelling at me because of the time. Last night, I had trouble getting to sleep. I ~~lied~~ lay there, but sleep wouldn't come. Instead, I thought about that day's events. The line between dream and reality is a very fine one; I often get the two mixed up. I'm certain people can agree with this, given my tendencies to get confused about whether something I say happened did actually occur, or if it was merely a dream. Mental condition?

I thought about how ironic it would be for one's sole desire to be to want to see _ER_ before their death, but they see _an_ ER instead as they're dying, never getting to see the show. Why so grim?

My FOIA request from [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/) or information in regards to its status at the very least has yet to arrive. Concerned is me.

I'm sure I'll be sweet dreamin' tonight.
