With Spring break coming to a close, I think now would be an appropriate moment for reflection.

I had been looking forward to this past Monday forever, if not that then all Winter. What was so special about it? It was *supposed* to be the first day of Spring. I wasn't expecting a magical scene with cheery people and fresh blooms---nah, not in the least bit. I was hoping for, if anything, sun and warm weather. I got neither. All I got was more cold, abandoned plans, and of all things, SNOW! Man, I was pissed. That was like the ultimate bitch slap, with the exception of the one from that leaf that got me good in the face that night.

But for the first time in ages Tyi, Wintaye and myself were all scheduled to work that night. I like to call us the Triple Threat, 'cause that's how we do it. Anyway. We were supposed to grab a bite to eat/hang out after work, but people were lame and backed out. So I called Allison wanting to hangout and waited for her at Cartel for a little bit, only for her to not show because of poor road conditions. After waiting for another hour for a cab that I don't think ever showed up, I barely managed to catch the last Kingshighway bus home.

On second thought, fuck it. I'm in pretty bad moods and it all just seems so trivial---in sum, a good part of this was about time spent with Tyi. See, that wasn't so bad? I hate Metro beyond belief. It's interesting that the thought of having to go back makes me this angry...and I'm not even an angry person! Wow.
