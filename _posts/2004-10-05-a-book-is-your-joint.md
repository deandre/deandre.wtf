And so said Kyle. And yes, joint as in weed.

Everyone had a grimace of gloom as they turned in their exams; it was almost as if they were looking down on a deceased loved one, parting their final farewells. I got mild amusement out of this observation.

I experienced some difficulty in answering the first short answer questions. What I mean is I am not sure if I gave the answers that he was looking for (read: probably misunderstood the questions). Then the essays, nothing but ramble. Hug me. I pray to Bujquejuejuew that I did all right. I am done with it though, it is beyond my control. Que sera, sera.

Pensive. Relaxed. Always doing something new, or atleast I am always noticing something new: the semi-tight-fitting black Korgi shirt, the cloth bracelet, the haircut, the black button-down shirt. Hottt. Yes, with three "t's."

I also love how everyone seems to answer MacKenzie's questions *with* questions.

I am so close to getting my free iPod. [Help me out](#) and [get one for yourself](#).
