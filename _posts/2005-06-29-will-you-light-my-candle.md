Oh, the excitement! As of this moment, there are 194,420 minutes until [RENT](https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/rent/) is due out in theaters this fall. Shooting is complete and the trailer looks amazing (I even began to tear up a little bit.) Geez, I can barely keep it in my pants!

Last year, I missed RENT at [the Fox](https://fabulousfox.com/). This year I'm gonna make sure I don't â€” mark your calendars for the weekend of March 17. Fuck, I forget that this is '06. Oh well, the more time, the better. (Right?)

Oh, and don't forget to check out the [RENT movie blog](https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/rent/blog/). Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna queue RENT up in iTunes.
