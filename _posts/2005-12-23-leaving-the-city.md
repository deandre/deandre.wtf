This afternoon my train will depart at 3:30pm, leaving for Jefferson City. Not quite my midnight train to Georgia, but it's getting there. This week, recapitulated: (atleast what I can remember of it)

Monday\
Last weekend I told myself that I would send off my application to Columbia College Chicago regardless of what might happen, and I did. I've never been more of a nervous wreck. For one, I'm unsure of my essay. After many good reviews and a highly critical one, I was at a lost as to how to revise it. I finally had Allison read it and she agreed that while it was very good as is, I could have elaborated more. To bad I recieved this information after I Mayham sent it off certified mail. That and my main recommendation fell through. I figured Lathrop would have the best idea out of any of the staff about my "situation(s), issues," what have you, so I thought a recommendation from her would be ideal. But with her being on leave, I had to fall back on Dr. Ahmad, an instructor I had a couple of summers ago at Rolla. Understandably, it's going to be more generic. And I'm really worried about this. The whole application package didn't work out as planned...I was going to enclose everything in a little binder or folder all decorated and shit, and include a portfolio of what work I do have. Being in the rush I was, needless to say, that didn't happen. I'm just hoping for the best.

Tuesday\
I "took" my last final. After waiting around for what seemed ages for the staff and faculty to quit pigging out, I sat down with Deane to change my schedule. I wanted to drop the remainder of my IB load, but was forced to keep Biology and Math. Biology, I'm OK with...I secretly love that class because it's the most hilarious and ridiculous ever! It's only the IB exams that I dread, because according to the practice ones I've taken, I suck at them. But it's cool, I guess. It's only a number that means nothing to me. I don't really care for advanced credit.

I also managed to swallow a pill(!). It going down was the most shocking experience because I wasn't expecting to. Granted, it was tiny as fuck. After doing so, I wanted so badly to see what else I can swallow. It was a sleeping pill, which leads me into...

Wednesday\
I had went to bed around 9, maybe 10 the night before. I woke up a bit after 10, so I was out for a good 12 hours. The sleep was much needed; I haven't felt that not-tired in so long. I'm hesitant to take any more, that whole thing about dependency. In fact, I almost prided myself on never have taken any, because I felt as if I didn't need to rely on those fucking pharmaceutical companies to solve my problems. I'm straying away from Wednesday. Anyway, around noon I left for Metro by way of the Lee-Sarah buses. Turned in my math project (although it hadn't improved as much as I had planned) and got my RNB from Tobias. He had heard through the grapevine that I dropped his class---and was all too thrilled. In retrospect, I'm not sure if I should be offended or what. The way I figure it: I don't need an art class to do art. I'll just do it on my own terms, without having to worry too much about arbitrary deadlines and what have you. You'll still see me in that room, hellas. He read through what I had wrote for the final and suggested that I enroll in Painting & Drawing. I was likeÂ *You're missing the point.*

I had work later that night. It sucked so much. People were so greater-than-thou and yuppy. I wanted to bitch slap them all. Although, although. A ton of surprises, and by ton, I mean two big ones. I was too excited to see Jenn when she came by because it seems like I haven't seen her in forever although really it's been a few days. She brought with her an unexpected guest: Dwight. I was too surprised to see him 'cause like he just disappeared. It was nice though, I guess. Later that night Tyi also dropped by. I've found that his mere presence always makes me happy. I remember once after school recently I was hanging out with Wintaye in the window. Then like he randomly pops out of Marquita's room. Such a good feeling, like reuniting with a BFF from like ages ago. I've been having a lot of those lately. That night was no exception.

Ruth also let me borrow her SLR, which was really awesome of her. I thought I'd take it down to JC with me, but I figured it would be best to leave it here and save the experimenting for more familiar settings.

I'm gonna skip over Thursday because nothing happened that's worth writing about, and today hasn't ended yet.
