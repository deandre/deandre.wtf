[Love](/mending/), and I use the term loosely, is a [bitch](/teasin/)Â and it [seems](/desire/) [to be](/alexander/) a [recurring](/focus/) [theme](/between-boners-and-boxers/) in [my](/apologies-are-useless-without-an-address-to-send-them-to/) [life](ive-got-extra-love/). Quite frankly, I'm through with it. It does me no good--a bunch of wanting and giving. And for what? Nothing, but anxiety and heartache. What am I complaining about though? I look at the problems of others and mine seem so trivial. Quit tormenting yourself, you don't deserve it. Love is a battlefield, and I'm putting down my guns.

The other day, a friend asked if I think I'm a good person; I wasn't able to give an answer. And that surprised me. One would think that it's a relatively simple question. But I'm a stranger to myself; I know too little about me. Clearly, I'm not happy. I don't know what I can do to "fix" that because I wouldn't know where to begin.
