Damnit, school tomorrow. I was enjoying the (5-day, mind you) weekend. Not only was it enjoyable, it was also productive.

For one, I submitted an IB Art research notebook that I am (somewhat) proud of, albeit late. Tobias wanted us to research Etruscan art, as well as a couple of pieces from the [local art museum](https://slam.org/ "Saint Louis Art Museum"). I must admit, I was not particularly interested in the assignment, as usual---you've seen one ancient scuplture, you've seen them all. However, the difference between this particular assignment and previous ones is that I just did it, sans gripes, allowing few distractions. Now, maybe it's just me, but I feel that this is a step in the right direction towards completing goal #17 of [51 in 501](/51-in-501/).

I've read the [first book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0064407667/qid=1106079987/sr=1-7/ref=sr_1_7/102-5511897-9807367?v=glance&s=books) of Lemony Snicket's ) _[A Series of Unfortunate Events](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060784660/qid=1106079987/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5511897-9807367?v=glance&s=books)_. In addition, I've been reading up on _[Security Clearance Law and Procedure](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1878810472/qid=1106080172/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/102-5511897-9807367?v=glance&s=books)_. I've had to wait a good week or two for this book to arrive from the Maryland State Law Library — not a _**single**_ library in this hick state of Missour*a* carries it. It also would have been nice to know that interlibrary loan transactions incur postages fees, although the charge was only a dollar. Still, it's better than paying Amazon the $83 they want for it.

While it is a good read thusfar, I am a bit disappointed that it only covers the lower-level security clearances (Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret), as opposed to the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance that really holds my interest. Nevertheless, it discusses the various criterion for obtaining a clearance and gives examples of cases. (Sidenote: I must get through _[Body of Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385499086/qid=1106080792/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-5511897-9807367)_ soon; the library wants it back.)

I had a killer headache this past Friday, the kind that leads me to belive I'm gonna die from some artery popping under the pressure. It got to the point where I was willing to pop any kind of pill (I can't swallow them for crap). Concerned, I once again browsed WebMD and learned of cluster and tension headaches, and what anuerysm really are (I always thought the arteries in your temple pop, which induce death; no, apparantly they often pop in the abdomen). While there, I got the brilliant idea of keeping a log of my headaches. I have an appointment with my doctor on the 10th of next month, hopefully some useful information will follow. My mom had me call one of my doctor's nurses the other day. I described the headaches as best I could (this was before I started keeping log), and she concluded that I have sinus headaches, and prescribed I take Sudafed. Well, that brings me back to the whole pill-popping dilemma, or inability to do so, for that matter.

A quick perusal of [STLtoday](https://www.stltoday.com/news/education) gives little indication of whether the teachers will strike. Last I heard, they're scheduled to cast their ballots at 3. Or maybe the ballots were supposed to be counted at 3. Anyway, there's word that the union and the [school board](https://slps.org/ "Our School District is Fucked") have reached a tentative agreement, and that the president of the teacher's union is now encouraging teachers to not strike. Great, steal my fun. I don't mean to sound cold, but I was secretly hoping there would be a strike. Don't get me wrong, I am not looking to get out of class or anything, and I completely symphathize with the teachers, but quite frankly, **I need a little drama**. Saint Louis is a rather dry city in itself; I'll take anything to spice it up a bit. (Yet another sidenote: you know your art museum is awesome when its acronym forms the word 'slam'.)
