One thing that I really hate about the Internet is the miscommunication, the impression of insincerity that one might get, though your intent is opposite.

I need to start working out again, especially if I am going to do Track/Cross Country next year. That is probably a lie; we will see.

Can anyone send me a Gmail invite, or point me in the direction of where I might find one?

Sincerely,
Kevin Harris
