Don't you hate when you feel as if you've been daydreaming forever, but after turning around and glancing at the clock, only a minute has passed by? I like to gaze out of the window during trig and watch the cars rush down 40 while I sit idle. Early this morning I burned a wonderful compilation featuring the haunting melodies of Celtic women, the exuberant Ben Folds Five, Bitch and Animal, and Pretty Girls Make Graves, and the somber System Of A Down. It's mixed brilliantly, burnt in alphabetical order by song title, which saves me the trouble of using my CD player's shuffle.

I listened to it primarily during art, which was very productive. Tobias gave me a great idea for a project, which in actuality could be considered a series of projects.

And I'm done. Tired of talking//MacKenzie paper that needs thinking abouting.
