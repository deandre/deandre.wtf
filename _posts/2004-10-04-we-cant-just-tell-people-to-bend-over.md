And so said Yale.

We watched the first scene of one of the Monty Python movies in History of the Americas, which I thought was really great. I did not recognize it until the very first part with the monks and the boards... hilarious. I am laughing just thinking about it.

Man, good times. I need to watch that. Monty Python. I have never seen the entire thing, which is said, je sais.

And apparantly the boy with the spiffy hair (Neil) wants my ass. We will see how this goes. But just to ensure that this will forever remain in my memory:

Metro's BBQ 2004. Entrance of the gymnasium, standing with Allison. I see the boy, then ask Allison what she thinks: "Gaydar, gay or what?" She says "No, not gay." We enter a mild state of contemplation. The boy walks past us and as he does so, says (to someone that he's walking with) "...I am queer..." It was the timing that made it so hilarious. Like I said, that is for my memories.
