I promised a rant against Tobias, but I figure that once we actually get into doing our own thing, I will be just fine. But my beef is now with History of the Americas and Trigonometry.

History of the Americas... all I do is sit, doodle, and think. I might try to include myself in the discussion, but it is dominated by others. So I back off, it is like "Whatever, she all ready said it." And he just talks and talks and rambles on and on. Oh my Gawd, can we do something else for Heathen's sake? I would appreciate a test, or a video, or something other than "discussion."

And Trigonometry? Campbell?! I entered that class at the beginning of the year feeling optimistic and enthusiastic. But now, I am drained. I feel like the life is being sucked outta me while sitting through that, unbearable hell.
