Chest pains, throat aches, tingly sensations (and not in the good way). Chills, fever, debilitating coughs---sickness is a bitch and I try to avoid it like the plague. Physical pain, however, I seem to be able to deal with. It's the emotional blows that I seem to curl up like a baby about.

Last night, I had a conversation with myself. It basically boiled down to me wanting to drop IB/Metro because I felt really behind (Art, Achebe/External Assessment, Nolte, et cetera). I convinced myself that today would be hell. Combining the sickness with Trig and that French test, I thought I wouldn't have been able to bear it.

Honestly, today wasn't that bad---nothing I couldn't handle. So for future reference: *relax, you'll be fine*.
