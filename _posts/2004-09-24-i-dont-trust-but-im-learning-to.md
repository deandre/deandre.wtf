I have gained a new respect for several people---Kyle, Yale, and Marjorie among them. My somewhat baseless first impression of Yale now gone, he is really an okay guy, and quite admirable at that. They are not bad people, they just have different opinions (and Yale simply does not reserve vocalizing his opinions, which is a quality I somewhat lack and feel would be nice to have). And is that not what I always preach, what I strive for---the embrace of other's opinions? Every now and then I might slip away from what I believe in. I just need to give people a chance.

I have a rant in mind, which I will get out eventually. But, Tobias. I do not like him. I think that he is an ass. For some reason, he comes off as ignorant and stuck-up to me. I will save my other issues with him for my rant. Today though, he expressed kindness and concern to me. He asked me "How's it going?" That was nice of him.

I was always intrigued by his charm, and still am. I am not sure what it is about it, though I have an idea: the rarity of seeing it. Most likely, you are not aware of what I am talking about. If that is the case, then I am referring to Anh's necklace.

Location: IB World Lit. I was so very disturbed by certain events that occurred during the period. Songs that contain lyrics to the likeness of "Hi, my name is Bob and I work in a button factory" and "Father Abraham has many sons" are firmly embedded in my mind and will haunt me forever. Perhaps what is worse are images of the accompanying motions (I dare not call them dances) to said songs.

Gay-Straight Alliance met today. There were certain topics I wanted to discuss---what exactly a GSA is, future plans---but some stuff I did not get around to because I was running late. Now, why was I running late, especially considering I initially showed up 15 minutes in advance? Well, there were materials I needed to print. Okay, continue? You see, I was not able to access said materials for anything pertaining to "Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Interest" is blocked by the proverbial and infamous Websense. Of course I had/have a problem with this. After TOK, Will and I asked Lathrop about it. She said it was district policy, consulted Mayham and Georgia, and they gave reasons for it. They totally missed our point. I mean, I cannot even look up fundraising resources for GSA because it is on a **QUEER** Web site. I was disappointed, felt nearly defeated even. But I am going to look more into these policies. It is not fair.

And only at Metro will large groups of people congregate outside of your 8th period class to sing "Happy Birthday" to you and present a (cookie) cake sporting, in green icing, the phrase "Happy Birthday the Metro Way." I wish I had my camera.

An excerpt from an essay that I am working on:

> I thought about people who live in a sort of opaque bubble, oblivious to life around them, or reality at the least and perhaps more accurately. They deny what might be referred to as the truth, and choose to live in their own little protected worlds, worlds of deception and lies---though not to them, for they are living in what they consider to be reality. But if these people are exposed to things on the outside of their bubbles, it may be said that they gain knowledge---knowledge of something other than their normal, their reality. As these people are pushed to continue to gain knowledge, or knowledge is shared with them in one form or another, their view of the world---their outlook on life---is altered; however, it being human nature to not want to venture beyond our comfort zone, we might resist this knowledge and revert to our "old" ways. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained from the initial exposure remains. It is up to the individual to find some truth in what they have learned, for the world has now been revealed to them.
