I have not heard Anh speak in awhile; I almost forgot what he sounds like.

Metro is the epitome of fucking hilariousness. Rehearsing/choreographing a dance for the kick-off = good ass times. A lot of things happened that day. I think I am beginning to fall for Tyi. What is with me and the straight guys?

Three As, one B, two Cs, and an F. Hot damn, the story of my life.

If I were a straight boy, I would totally crush on Candice. Yes, she is that hot (discreet reference to an earlier experience).

One thing I notice: I write about things from days, maybe even weeks back, which I feel may lead to confusion, as I might omit details for whatever reasons. Just deal with it.

I am totally the slacker, just today starting Biology, Literature, and TOK assignments, all of which are due tomorrow. I got a surprising amount done within a time frame of a couple hours: the meat of Biology (i.e. review questions) and that MacKenzie essay. Now for TOK. That is going to be the challenge--I am way too tired to think that "in-depth." I want to get to sleep soon, so that means I will not get any further in *Angels & Demons* tonight.

I (heart) that book! I so want to infiltrate the Vatican now. You know, I had no idea the Vatican is its own country. How about that Swiss Guard?

And how about that PSAT preparation? A round of frisbee pre-7 a.m. Only at Metro, and only with Alex. But it was much needed, it was rather relaxing. The air was cool (hell, I was cold), but I found it to be refreshing. Some serious good times.
