TOK, I feel, was pretty great. Aside from the usual discussion, a couple of Metro grads-Kate and Amanda (maybe Amantha?)-were apparantly visiting and joined us. They talked about stuff, who they are, where they are going, how they are liking stuff. But it was Aman(d/th)a's account of something that happened in her dorm that was particularly amusing.

So you see, dorms the night before finals. This one chick decides to fry chicken at like 3 am. She leaves, and a fire sparks. And the alarms are going off, Aman(d/th)a was all like "Screw it, I am studying." Aman(d/th)a's roomie then came in all like "Aman(d/th)a, grab yo' shit and RUN!" To add to all of this, the chicken chick tried to put out the fire-a grease fire, mind you-by dousing it with water. Not very smart.

It was funnier coming from her, it always is (the original person, that is, or someone who was there... a first-hand account).

But I remembered what I forgot the other day. It was merely an observation in IB World Lit. Well, like groups were presenting books of The Odyssey, and a thought struck me: there are four queer people in this room, that I know of. It was like "Well. If there are four just in this room, oh how many more there must be out there." Weird. It seemed more relevant or something at the time.
