And believe it or not, that's not sarcasm. I really did enjoy it. I am so estatic and excited about everything. Tonight at work even, I didn't (silently) tell anyone off, which shocked even me. Okay, fine. At the very end I was sucked into conversation about this one lady who clearly treats us like shit all the time (she always comes back, why?). Except for that, I was really upbeat and friendly and in good spirits all around. Wow. Caught the bus home just now. That was an interesting walk--very nice breeze. I get home and there was darkness.
