Bruce opened class (a good half hour late, I want to say) with some insight that I will share. He said, and I paraphrase, that sure, we may want to blow off our few remaining weeks, but everyday has something good to offer, something for you to take from it. Those are some of the wisest words I've heard in some time, and he's totally right. I completely agree with him it's just that my loathing for Metro causes me to lose sight of such things. I figured rather than waking up pissed at the world that I have to go to school, I'll wake up pleased that it's one less day until the end of it. I also think I'll stop falling asleep in classes, and start doing my homework, which brings me to...

...an assignment that he gave. The prompt is something along the lines of _Write about something you've learned, contextualized in your childhood_. A very rough paraphrase because honestly, no one knows what exactly the fuck we're supposed to be writing about. Still, my premise is that my childhood is virtually non-existant because I remember almost nothing about it. (My memory is terrible, if you didn't catch that.) It's quite sad, because I often hear people reminiscing on how they did this and went there, yet, I have nothing. I managed to jot down a couple of paragraphs, starting with how my homelife was never typical. There are still so many blanks to fill in: Why, for instance. I'm a firm believer that things happen for a reason---take for example when I found that digital camera lying in the street and contemplated for a week rather or not to return it. I eventually did, after going through all that drama with Kyle taking my CD player right from under me and getting away with it.

Tonight at work, to my surprise, there was a benefit night for of all organizations my old elementary school. Oh man: Ms. Russel, Ms. Robinson, Ms. Jackson, it was pretty insane. But in some strange way that gave me a bit of guidance which I will follow later on tonight when writing this damn thing. Seeing so many familiar faces, and new faces, was amazing. I secretly miss that place---the good ol' days, right? (Like I'd know.)

I've confirmed the dates of IB testing: May 3rd, 4th, and 5th. The beauty in this is that I only have one paper that Friday and it's in the morning, so with some slick maneuvering, I might be able to make it to Chicago in time to relax a little bit before catching the [concert](https://www.prettygirlsmakegraves.com/). I need to check with Wintaye, Meade, and Tyi about this real soon because I seriously want to do this. So it worked out, it seems---no need to skip exams after all. Well, assuming everything else goes accordingly.

Nearly two months after it was dated, I finally recieved my acceptance letter from [Columbia](https://www.colum.edu/). Sure, this is great (official) news and all, but with it I realize the pinch that I'm in. I need to come up with $750 for housing and tuition deposits by May 1st. Just now I e-mailed Matt asking for more hours, and I'm expecting a good amount assuming I'm selected to be a queer peer mentor. But I've also realized that if worse comes to worse, I may have to defer admission until the spring. Does that suck as much as it sounds? I mean doing so will certainly allow me to save up the much needed cash. I'm just not sure I want to stick around here for much longer than I have to.
