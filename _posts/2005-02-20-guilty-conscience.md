I am unstable. On the exterior, I may portary a reasonably sane individual--but it's merely an appearance, as things aren't always what they seem. Beneath the veil, I am a twisted soul. It would be better for me to be locked away now, for there's no telling what I'll do in the future.

What seems like so many years of endless questioning has apparantly fucked me up. But then again, things aren't always what they seem.

The answers to those questions (many still remain unanswered) have led me to be cynical of any and all forms of authority. One might call me paranoid, but I disagree.

I am led solely by my curiosity, checked only by *my* values, ethics, or what have you, and even those are up for debate.

I am not afraid of death. My only fear is myself.

So who's to stop me?
