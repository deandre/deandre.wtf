The whole concept of (Great) Britain, the United Kingdom, and the Commonwealth perplex me. For the longest, I have stated that I hate Britain. Perhaps this is why: it confuses me so! See, I once thought I had a pretty good understanding of it, but then my certainties were challenged. Once again, I felt that I have establised understanding, but that feeling soon vanished. Enter the now and I know not what to think. Alas, Shawn tried to explain sometime ago---others even joined in---but I simply grew further confused. Woe is me.

Remember the power outage a couple weeks back? Word is it did not affect just Metro. Sure, it was rather narrow-minded of me to assume that it was an isolated incident. Moreover, it would be more reasonable an assumption to think that the surrounding area went dark as well. I was told through the Grapevine that Career Academy blacked out at the same time. That leaves me with two likely scenarios: either a) the entire mile or so stretch from here to Grand was without power, or b) somebody Downtown did not pay their electric bill.

I am loving the hilarity ofÂ LitM^2^.

I also find myself having the most difficult time categorizing my entries. Please, pardon the chaos as I figure things out.
