I've been out since 9 this morning. Had a queer youth summit to attend at Wash U. Very interesting. Great people. Get a bunch of fags and dykes together and you get DRAMA. I mean damn.

Work was amazing. Met a cool chick named Natalie, Elissa's friend. Craziness all around. Massive cleanup...it's amazing how clean that place is even after what it's been through tonight. Line out the door for the restroom. Sid Vicious and Jack the Ripper. We didn't get out until 2...disregarding the time shift. Fucker.

Well I seriously do like Tyi, I'm cool with it. We're cool. That's cool. Dacia, he, and I need to hangout. Serious plans with everyone, geez. Rocky Horror next weekend instead of Chicago... I wouldn't have had the money for it anyway.

Jenn is a wonderful girl who deserves someone who treats her right. Played video crack with her at Cartel for a few. Was going to walk her home but she wanted alone time.

I'm so gayed out right now. And I reek of smoke...
