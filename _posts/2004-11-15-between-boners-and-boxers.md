I have been experiencing bad moods lately, on and off. Depression it seems. I have also been torn. On one hand, I love Metro--I adore it dearly. But on the other, I detest it. Perhaps this is the status quo nowadays?

My mom hugged and expressed her love for me this morning. As awkward and random as it was, it was much needed. Thank you.

> This is a disorienting time to be an American homo. George W. Bush appears to have won the White House on "values," not security, "values" being code for gay marriage, abortion, and stem cells--but mostly gay marriage. Anti-gay marriage amendments passed in 11 states, and pundits are saying that the anti-gay vote got Bush elected. Okay, so America hates the gays--that I can live with, and it means we should probably get the fuck out while getting the fucking out is good.

If I were to ever become president, I would probably be assassinated, not (necessarily) because of my race, but because my "agenda" might be viewed as too radical to half of the population.

That agenda of mine would include acceptance (yes acceptance! not just tolerance) of everyone, without regard to race, sexual orientation, gender and other biases. My administration would not be influenced by the Christian right or ~~corporate America~~ big business. America would actually have relations with the rest of the world. *Get out of Iraq and mind your own damn business.* (Truman Doctrine ring a bell?) Our military will be trimmed to, in essence, a self-defense force with limited offensive capability. Information freedom will actually have a chance. Agencies such as the FCC, organizations such as the RIAA and MPAA, and companies such as AOL and Microsoft will be abolished. DMCA what? PATRIOT who? DRM, TIA, CIPA, I spit on it. Howard Stern would be able to speak freely without having to broadcast over satellite. Don't like it? Tough. Pack up your things and move to Texas.

Until then, _[sorry everybody](https://sorryeverybody.com/)_.

The highlight of my day:

> **Lorenc:** Oh and BTW, the whole school knows you like Shawn, including Shawn himself.\
> **Kevin:** LMAO How did this come about?\
> **Lorenc:** Yesterday I was at Nick's house with Shawn and Justin and somehow this came up, and they all knew about it, Shawn since last year although he didn't believe it until recently.

Expect an essay from me soon.
