I saw what I percieved to be a gay pride flag while riding Marcus the other morning. This reminded me of a couple weeks back when I saw what I percieved to be a queer Kerry/Edwards sign. I was enthused, both times. I mean, it is not like Saint Louis' northside comes to mind when I think queer.

So as it turns out, the boy is not queer. My hopes are shot. Looks like reality won. But the fact that he confronted thoughts and feelings that others might well just avoid, and actually was able to openly share his feelings with me, means ~~so, so much more~~ a lot. ~~Any~~ That girl of his desire would be lucky to have him.
