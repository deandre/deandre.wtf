The concept of language perplexes me. **How is language learned?** As a language student, the answer might be obvious: through commercially-produced visual and auditory activities, as well as the occasional handout. However, as a language student, I also possess a language base; I knew English before I began my study of French, or any other language for that matter. **How did I learn English?** I remember owning Hooked on Phonics. Only recently have I actually thrown it away, and to this day I feel it is a scam---a waste of money. Looking back, this is really difficult for me to comprehend. **How did I go from nothing, to where I am now?** (In regards to language, that is.) As an infant, you know nothing of words, and comprehensible speech. **How does one acquire language, how does one **teach** language?**

I suppose I am going in circles there, so I am going to consider this a honeypot of questions for future entries or what have you on the subject. That said, I would like to toss something else in: translation. Mme Hembel shed some light on *who* determines the association of words in which language with words of another, but not *how* and on *what* those associations are based.

Future reading, not necessarily language-oriented, but for sake of rememberance:

- _The Language Police_
- _The Denial of Death_, Ernest Becker
