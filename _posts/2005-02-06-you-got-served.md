I dance when no one's looking. To entertain myself while doing dishes last night, I popped in the Dizzee mix that Jewelia made for me and honey, let me tell you---there was more poppin' than washin'.

Just for the record, Lysol should **never** under any circumstances be used as air freshener. My mom seems to not understand this and uses it constantly to deodorize the bathroom. I'm sorry, but there is no reason why I should suffocate on the stuff when showering.

What's with guys and their thing for chicks rough-housing in mud? I mean come on, dude. It's mud! Give me something more water-based (like KY) and a good-looking guy; then and only then will we talk.

And no, I don't squint while masturbating...unless my eyes are like closed or something.
