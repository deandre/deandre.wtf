According to Jenn and her mother who's a nurse, I have the flu. It makes sense, because I have never experienced extreme chills or crippling bodyaches before when sick. <cynicism>Fucking great.</cynicism> In other news, how bigoted must one be to [sue for the right to be intolerant](https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-christians10apr10,0,6204444.story?coll=la-home-headlines)? All I can say is Wow.
